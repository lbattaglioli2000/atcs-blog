# Advanced Topics | **PHP Lab #5**

This GitHub Repository contains **all** of the code that I have written for the PHP Lab #5.

This is a pretty tricky lab, so hopefully my code can act as a sort of "Hitchhiker's Guide to Building a Crappy Blogging System in PHP and MySql" (copyright is still pending on that, just as it is with *ZippyReg2*)

Now, enjoy my Merlis inspired directions:

```
if(you.have() == Issue){
  $issue = new Issue;
  $issue.submit();
}
```

That's kinda vague, like all of the test questions in this class.

To fill out a god damn issue report, just go to [the issues page](https://github.com/lbattaglioli2000/atcs-blog/issues/new) and fill out the damn form. I'll get back to you eventually.
